    <p class="boppard-text">
      Germany is a place full of history where anywhere you are there is a mark of it. The first time I went to Germany was after a 16 hours bus ride to Boppard! I had gone on a Germany school trip as I did GCSE German.  Boppard is a small town that borders the River Rhine which has beautiful river views to go on when the sunsets. Boppard has a lovely walkway along the river where you can see different sites along the river. I stayed in a hotel that was about 2 minutes away from the river, so we definately made sure we went to on an after-dinner walk. Because we were staying in Boppard, we were able to go to other places surrounding it. <br><br>After we spent a night at the hotel, we got the opportunity to go to Phantasialand in Brühl, a theme park with tons to do! We initially were a group of 10 but, then we had to split because the boys wanted to go on a spinning roller-coaster which I just can’t. We got to even go on the Taron – the fastest and longest multi-launched roller coaster in the world! Before this theme park, I couldn’t even get on a rollercoaster which was a big achievement for me! There were so many amazing rides such as the Chiapas, Black Panther, River Quest and so many more! I would recommend you plan what rides you want to go on first, we went on the River Quest last and got soaked! Which wouldn’t have been too bad if we went on another ride after, we had to spend about an hour and a half in wet clothes as we made our way back to the hotel.
      <br><br>The next day we drove to Köln to go to the Lindt Schokoladenmuseum which is an interesting story. As you know we went to Germany as a school trip, so we had to meet certain deadlines to meet everyone. So, my friend and I forgot the meeting time and were busy eating the freebies and taking a bunch of photos. Because we forgot, the teachers requested to call our names on the tannoy which we were very confused with, so we rushed out. After a few hours in the museum, we were taken on the bus and dropped outside the Köln Kathedral where we were free to roam around the city. After so many days of not eating out, where was the first place everyone went; McDonald’s! After that quick detour, we had a chance to go into the Cathedral which has beautiful stain glass pieces and it was very peaceful. After we started walking around the city, where we took regular headcounts in case someone got lost. We had a few parkour sessions and then went into a few shops around the centre. We ended up spending an hour in a video game store where I was taught how to play Mario Kart on a Switch. <br><br>The day after we went to a small town called Rüdesheim am Rhein where we took a cable car to the top of the hillside where you got amazing views of the River Rhine and the rest of the town. At the top of the hillside, there was a grand statue called the Niederwalddenkmal which celebrates the unification of Germany. From Rüdesheim am Rhein we took a Rhine river cruise to Boppard. The river cruise was so beautiful, going past all the little towns along the river. We played a cards game on the cruise which we played quite often on the trip. The next day was departure day, we packed all our belongings and had a final family side breakfast and went back to the bus which was another 16-hour journey.
